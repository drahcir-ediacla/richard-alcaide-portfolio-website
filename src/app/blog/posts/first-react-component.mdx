# Your First React Component: A Step-by-Step Guide

React is one of the most popular libraries for building user interfaces. If youâ€™re new to React, the best place to start is by creating your very first component. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through building a simple functional component, and explain two key concepts: **props** and **state**.

---

## What is a Component?

A **component** in React is like a building block of your UI. You can think of it as a reusable piece of code that represents part of the interfaceâ€”such as a button, header, or card.

Components can be **functional** or **class-based**. Nowadays, functional components are the standard way to write React, so thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll use.

---

## Step 1: Create a Functional Component

Hereâ€™s the simplest example of a functional component:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

This component just returns some JSX (JavaScript XML), which looks like HTML but has the full power of JavaScript.

You can use this component in your app like this:

```jsx
import Welcome from "./Welcome";

function App() {
  return <Welcome />;
}
```

---

## Step 2: Add Props

**Props** (short for *properties*) let you pass data into a component from the outside. Think of them like function parameters.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

Now, when you use this component, you can pass in a `name`:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Richard" />;
}
```

The output will be:

```
Hello, Richard!
```

---

## Step 3: Add State

While **props** are passed *into* a component, **state** is data that a component *manages itself*. You can think of it as memory for your component.

React gives us the `useState` hook to manage state in functional components.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:
- `useState(0)` creates a state variable `count` with an initial value of `0`.
- `setCount` is a function that updates `count`.
- When the button is clicked, `setCount(count + 1)` increases the value.

---

## Step 4: Put It Together

Now letâ€™s combine both **props** and **state** into one component.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function WelcomeCounter({ name }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default WelcomeCounter;
```

Usage:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <WelcomeCounter name="Richard" />;
}
```

This will greet the user and keep track of how many times they click the button.

## Key Takeaways

- **Components** are reusable building blocks of your UI.
- **Props** allow components to receive data from the outside.
- **State** lets components manage their own data over time.

With these basics, youâ€™re ready to start building interactive UIs with React! ðŸŽ‰
