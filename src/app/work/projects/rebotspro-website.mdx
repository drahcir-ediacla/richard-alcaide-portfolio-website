## Overview

A complete product services website built for RebotsPro, a platform offering a help desk application. The project includes both a high-fidelity mockup design and a fully functional website. The design emphasizes a clean and professional look, highlighting product features, pricing plans, and customer benefits. The functional website brings the design to life with responsive layouts, interactive sections, and working forms, delivering a smooth and informative user experience for potential clients exploring the help desk solution.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens.
- **Figma Integration**: Collaborated closely with the project manager by setting up a shared design mockup and interactive prototype in Figma, enabling real-time feedback, streamlined design handoffs, and ensuring that both the development and design teams were aligned on user flows, visual hierarchy, and component specifications throughout the project lifecycle.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Utilized for building high-performance, server-rendered React applications with features like static site generation (SSG), server-side rendering (SSR), incremental static regeneration (ISR), and optimized routing for SEO and fast load times.
- **Figma**: Used to design, organize, and manage interactive prototypes and UI/UX assets, enabling seamless collaboration with team members, real-time feedback, and efficient design handoffs for development.
- **Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator**: Utilized for creating and editing high-quality graphics, including image retouching, vector illustrations, and design assets for web and print, ensuring visually compelling and professional results.
## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to maintain design consistency. The solution involved creating well-defined design tokens and establishing clear guidelines for when and how components could be customized. Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between designers and developers using Figma and Git was a learning experience that greatly improved the process.

## Outcome

The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
